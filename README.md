# IC Boxes project

This repository documents a collection of small projects built with various integrated circuits (ICs) I found in some old parts boxes I bought at a second-hand store.
Each project will use one or more ICs from the boxes.

The goals are:

- to improve my documentation skills
- to practice drawing schematics
- to get better with electronics in general
- and, of course, to have fun ðŸš€
