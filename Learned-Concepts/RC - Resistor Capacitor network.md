# RC - Resistor Capacitor network

A RC is a timing building in electronics

### - How it works
A Resistor (R) limits current (like a funnel).
A capacitor (C) stores and releases charge (like a bucket that can fill and empty).
Together they charge/discharge in a cycle that takes a certain time.

That timing is given by the time constant:
#### 𝜏=𝑅×𝐶
τ (tau) = the time it takes the capacitor to charge up to about 63% of the supply voltage (or discharge to 37%).

example: 
  R = 100kΩ, C = 10µF → τ = 1 second.
